# Artifical intelligence for robotics 

Here is some code from the artifical intelligence for robotics for udacity, they are not homework solutions rather some after thoughts I had and re-implementation of the course material using numpy and python 3. 

## Monte carlo localisation

Implementation of 2D monte carlo localisation using histogram filters in numpy.

Things we should add 
1. Noise term for motion

Things we need to try out
1. At a mode for hamming makers and compare the performace 
2. Maybe add localisation + motion planning ?
